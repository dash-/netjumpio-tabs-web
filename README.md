# TabSets: Role-Based Bookmarking

## About TabSets from Netjump.io

Modern desk jobs require workers to use a handful of web apps to perform their
roles.  From SaaS (Software as a Service) products like Salesforce.com to 
corporate intranet web apps, the first step toward performing a role is having
the right set of links.  How employees get these links varies widely from
organization to organization, from link-sharing via email to company Wikis to
consumer-grade Bookmark Management solutions.  But all these solutions have one
thing in common: they're weak, and they don't work well.  A strong, dedicated
solution to this ubiquitous business problem does not exist.

Until now.

TabSets from Netjump.io is not the first Bookmark Management solution, but it is
the first Role-Based Bookmarking solution.  TabSets provides advanced tools for
managing a complex directory of hyperlinks that exist within the enterprise,
organizations, groups, and roles.

Switching email web apps for your entire company? No problem. With TabSets, one
link can be changed, and the entire organization's bookmarks will be updated.

That's just the beginning, because we also recognize that hyperlinks can be
closely-guarded secrets -- which is another advantage to TabSets mirroring your
Role-Based Access Control system.  You can assign bookmarks to your salespeople,
accountants, developers, and executives based on their roles, and know that no
one has links to resources they shouldn't be attempting to access.
