# TabSets: Role-Based Bookmarking

## About TabSets from Netjump.io

Modern desk jobs require workers to use a handful of web apps to perform their
roles.  From SaaS (Software as a Service) products like Salesforce.com to 
corporate intranet web apps, the first step toward performing a role is having
the right set of links.  How employees get these links varies widely from
organization to organization because a strong, dedicated solution has never
existed...  until now.

TabSets from Netjump.io is not the first Bookmark Management solution, but it is
the first Role-Based Bookmarking solution.  A vast improvement over emailing
links or even sharing folders of bookmarks from person to person, TabSets
provides advanced tools for managing a complex directory of hyperlinks that
exist within the enterprise, organizations, groups, and roles.

Switching email web apps for your entire company? No problem. With TabSets, one
link can be changed, and the entire organization's bookmarks will be updated.
That's just the beginning, because we also recognize that hyperlinks can be
closely-guarded secrets -- which is another advantage to TabSets mirroring your
Role-Based Access Control system.
